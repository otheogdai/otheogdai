## 🚀 About Me

I'm a curious mind and problem solver from 🇧🇷 Brazil, working at **Vibra Energia** in the oil & gas industry.  
With a strong background in **Salesforce architecture**, **data integration** (MuleSoft, APIs), and **automation**, I help businesses grow through technology.

💼 Currently diving deeper into the **Anypoint Platform**, working toward my **MuleSoft Certification**.  
📸 When I’m not coding, I’m out capturing the essence of city life through **urban photography** – my "jobby" and passion.
